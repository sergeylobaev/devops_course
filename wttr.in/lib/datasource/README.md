Currently wttr.in uses just one data source, but more data sources must be added.
Having more data sources will increase data quality, and make it possible
to select data source basing on location, or on the user's preferences.

## Possible data sources

* OpenWeatherMap
* AccuWeather
* Windy.com
* yr.no
* [BBC WeatherFeeds](https://support.bbc.co.uk/platform/feeds/WeatherFeeds.htm)
* http://www.bom.gov.au
